# Smart-Inventory-Demand-Forecasting-with-AI
This project is an AI-powered inventory management and demand forecasting tool built for small and medium-sized retailers. Using historical sales data and machine learning, it predicts short-term product demand and helps store owners make data-driven restocking decisions.

This project builds a forecasting system for retail sales using Machine Learning and Deep Learning. It helps small retailers:
- Forecast demand for the next 7 days
- Detect inventory shortages
- Visualize sales and predictions
- Get restock alerts via dashboard

## 🚀 Features
- LSTM-based deep learning time-series model (TensorFlow/Keras)
- Random Forest forecasting for baseline
- Real-world retail dataset (Walmart M5 Forecasting)
- Streamlit dashboard with alert system
- Feature engineering: lags, rolling windows, prices
- Train/test evaluation with RMSE

## 📊 Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- TensorFlow / Keras, scikit-learn, Random Forest
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📥 Download Dataset
This project uses the **M5 Forecasting - Accuracy** dataset from Kaggle.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 📌 Data Preparation
- Converts wide format to long using `melt`
- Merges calendar and pricing info
- Creates lag & rolling mean features

### 🧠 Model Training
- `RandomForestRegressor` on feature-engineered data
- `LSTM` with 30-day sequence sliding window

### 📦 Inventory Alert
- User inputs current stock
- System checks demand > inventory → ⚠️ alert
