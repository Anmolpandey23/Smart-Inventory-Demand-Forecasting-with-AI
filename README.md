# Smart-Inventory-Demand-Forecasting-with-AI
This project is an AI-powered inventory management and demand forecasting tool built for small and medium-sized retailers. Using historical sales data and machine learning, it predicts short-term product demand and helps store owners make data-driven restocking decisions.

This project builds a forecasting system for retail sales using Machine Learning and Deep Learning. It helps small retailers:
- Forecast demand for the next 7 days
- Detect inventory shortages
- Visualize sales and predictions
- Get restock alerts via dashboard

## ðŸš€ Features
- LSTM-based deep learning time-series model (TensorFlow/Keras)
- Random Forest forecasting for baseline
- Real-world retail dataset (Walmart M5 Forecasting)
- Streamlit dashboard with alert system
- Feature engineering: lags, rolling windows, prices
- Train/test evaluation with RMSE

## ðŸ“Š Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- TensorFlow / Keras, scikit-learn, Random Forest
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
